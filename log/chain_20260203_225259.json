Using the examples provided:\n\n- For \\(f(n) = n + 1\\), there are no fixed points.\n- For \\(f(n) = 2n\\), the fixed point is \\(n = 0\\).\n- For \\(f(n) = n^2 - n\\), the fixed points are \\(n = 0\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n\nIf you have a specific function in mind for \\(f(n)\\), please provide it, and I will help you analyze it further.",

After plotting or using a numerical solver, we find the roots.\n\n### Step 5: Final Roots\nAfter testing rational numbers, we find the only real roots of the original equation to be approximately:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\] \n\nand potentially some other values which can be determined through numerical solving methods. Further checks around critical points lead to identifying more precise roots if necessary."
