Now, consider how many times 20 goes into 30 (the first two digits of 3.000):\n   - 20 goes into 30 once (1).\n   - 1 multiplied by 20 gives 20.\n   - Subtract 20 from 30 to get 10.\n\n3. Bring down the next digit (0) to make it 100.\n   - Now, see how many times 20 goes into 100.\n   - 20 goes into 100 five times (5).\n   - 5 multiplied by 20 gives 100.\n   - Subtract 100 from 100 to get 0.\n\n4. Since there are no more digits to bring down and the remainder is 0, we can conclude the division.\n\nPutting it all together, the result of the division is:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{20} = 0.15\n\\]\n\nSo, the decimal equivalent of \\(\\frac{3}{20}\\) is \\(0.15\\)."

The formula for the side length of a regular octagon (s_octagon) in terms of the hexagon's side length is derived from the geometry of the two shapes. A regular octagon can be inscribed in a circle, and the relationship can be established through trigonometry.\n\nThe side length \\( s \\) of a regular octagon inscribed in a circle is given by:\n\\[\ns = r \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - 2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{360^\\circ}{8}\\right)}\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circumcircle of the octagon.\n\nFor a regular hexagon, its radius (circumradius) is equal to its side length:\n\\[\nr = s_{\\text{hexagon}} = 16 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( r \\) into the octagon side length formula:\n\\[\ns_{\\text{octagon}} = 16 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - 2 \\cos(45^\\circ)}\n\\]\n\nKnowing that \\( \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\):\n\\[\ns_{\\text{octagon}} = 16 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n\\]\n\\[\n= 16 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\):\n1.

To calculate profit, we typically subtract the total costs from the total revenue. However, the cost information for the cookies, cupcakes, and brownies is not provided in the context.\n\nTo proceed, we can create a subtask to calculate the total profit, given some hypothetical costs for each item. For the sake of this example, let's assume the following costs:\n\n- Cost of cookies: $0.50 per cookie\n- Cost of cupcakes: $1.00 per cupcake\n- Cost of brownies: $0.30 per brownie\n\nUsing these costs, we can calculate the total cost and then determine the profit.\n\n### Subtask 1: Calculate Total Costs\n\n1. **Cookies**:\n   - Cost per cookie: $0.50\n   - Total cost for cookies:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for cookies} = 54 \\times 0.50 = 27 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Cupcakes**:\n   - Cost per cupcake: $1.00\n   - Total cost for cupcakes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for cupcakes} = 20 \\times 1.00 = 20 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Brownies**:\n   - Cost per brownie: $0.30\n   - Total cost for brownies:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost for brownies} = 35 \\times 0.30 = 10.5 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nNow, we will sum these costs to find the total cost:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Total cost for cookies} + \\text{Total cost for cupcakes} + \\text{Total cost for brownies}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the total cost.",

Here are the conditions required:\n\n### 1. Polynomial Form\nA polynomial is typically expressed in the form:\n\n\\[\np(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 x + a_0\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer representing the degree of the polynomial.\n- \\( a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\) are the coefficients of the polynomial, which can be real or complex numbers.\n\n### 2. Coefficients\nTo evaluate \\( p(8) \\), we need to know the coefficients \\( a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1, a_0 \\). These coefficients determine the specific polynomial we are working with. Without knowing these values, we cannot perform the evaluation. \n\n### 3. Evaluating at \\( x = 8 \\)\nOnce we have the polynomial in the correct form and the coefficients, we can substitute \\( x = 8 \\) into the polynomial:\n\n\\[\np(8) = a_n \\cdot 8^n + a_{n-1} \\cdot 8^{n-1} + \\ldots + a_1 \\cdot 8 + a_0\n\\]\n\n### Explanation of Each Condition\n- **Polynomial Form**: This condition ensures that we have a valid polynomial expression. A polynomial must adhere to the structure that involves powers of \\( x \\) and their respective coefficients.\n  \n- **Coefficients**: The specific values of the coefficients are crucial because they define the actual polynomial function we are examining. Different sets of coefficients will yield different polynomials, and thus different results when evaluated at \\( x = 8 \\).\n\n- **Substitution**: The process of evaluation involves substituting the value \\( 8 \\) into the polynomial. This means calculating powers of \\( 8 \\) and multiplying them by their respective coefficients, which ultimately results in a single numerical value.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn summary, to evaluate \\( p(8) \\), we need:\n1. A clear definition of the polynomial's form, ensuring it follows the standard polynomial structure.\n2. The specific coefficients that define the polynomial.\n3. The ability to substitute \\( x = 8 \\) into this polynomial and perform the necessary calculations to obtain the value \\( p(8) \\).",
