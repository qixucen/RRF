To satisfy the requirement of having 4 changes of direction, the sequence of moves can be represented by the pattern:\n- RRRRUUUU (No changes)\n- RRRRRUU (One change)\n- RRRRUGG (Two changes)\n- (And so forth)\n\nFor paths changing direction exactly four times, we can denote the segments as follows:\n- \\(a_1\\) right moves,\n- \\(b_1\\) up moves,\n- \\(a_2\\) right moves,\n- \\(b_2\\) up moves,\n- \\(a_3\\) right moves,\n- \\(b_3\\) up moves,\n- \\(a_4\\) right moves,\n- \\(b_4\\) up moves.\n\n### Step 3: Constraints\nThe requirements that must be met:\n1. The total number of right moves: \n   \\[\n   a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8.\n   \\]\n2. The total number of up moves:\n   \\[\n   b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 8.\n   \\]\n3. Each \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) must be positive integers for each segment.\n\n### Step 4: Transform to Positive Integers\nSince we need positive integers, we can make substitutions:\n- Let \\(c_i = a_i - 1\\) and \\(d_i = b_i - 1\\), transforming them to non-negative integers (i.e., \\(c_i, d_i \\geq 0\\)):\n    \\[\n    (c_1+1) + (c_2+1) + (c_3+1) + (c_4+1) = 8 \\implies c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 4,\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    (d_1+1) + (d_2+1) + (d_3+1) + (d_4+1) = 8 \\implies d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 4.\n    \\]\n### Step 5: Count Non-negative Solutions\nThe problem of finding non-negative integer solutions for both equations can be solved using the stars and bars combinatorial method. The number of solutions to \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = k\\) is given by \\(\\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}\\). Here \\(k=4\\) and \\(n=4\\).\n\nSo, for each equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions for: } c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 4 = \\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3}.\n\\]\nCalculating this:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35.\n\\]\n\nThe same calculation applies for \\(d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 4\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions for: } d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 4 = \\binom{7}{3} = 35.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Combine Counts\nTo find the total number of paths, we multiply the number of ways to distribute right moves and the number of ways to distribute up moves:\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \\(\\boxed{1225}\\).",

To have exactly 4 direction changes means that the sequence of moves can be divided into 5 segments, alternating between R's and U's.\n\n### Step 3: Defining segments\n\nWith 4 direction changes, our path segments will have the following structure:\n- Segment 1: R’s\n- Segment 2: U’s\n- Segment 3: R’s\n- Segment 4: U’s\n- Segment 5: R’s or U’s\n\nWe can denote the lengths of these segments:\n- Let \\( a_1 \\) be the length of the first R segment,\n- Let \\( b_1 \\) be the length of the first U segment,\n- Let \\( a_2 \\) be the length of the second R segment,\n- Let \\( b_2 \\) be the length of the second U segment,\n- Let \\( a_3 \\) be the length of the third R segment.\n\nThe total moves in each direction must satisfy:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total R's)}\n\\]\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total U's)}\n\\]\nThe \\( b_2 \\) segment can appear in two ways, either going higher at the end or as the last segment. However, we will just solve for the case where it can end with either segment, and distinguish later.\n\n### Step 4: Non-negative integer solutions\n\nTo count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equations, we apply the stars and bars method:\n\n**For R segments:**\nThe equation \\( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 8 \\) has \\( 3 \\) variables and can be solved using:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions} = \\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45.\n\\]\n\n**For U segments:**\nThe equation \\( b_1 + b_2 = 8 \\) has \\( 2 \\) variables and can be solved using:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions} = \\binom{8 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{9}{1} = 9.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total combinations of segments\n\nThe total number of ways to assign lengths to segments while ensuring 4 changes in direction can thus be calculated by multiplying the number of arrangements for R's and U's:\n\\[\n\\text{Total paths with 4 direction changes} = 45 \\times 9 = 405.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{405}.\n\\]",

If the path changes direction exactly four times, it means there are four segments, with each segment consisting of either R's or U's. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of the path\nEach path can structurally be represented as:\n- RRRRRRUUUUUU\n- segments of R's followed by segments of U's, which can be grouped into four alternating segments.\n\n### Step 2: Representation of segments\nLet’s denote the counts of R's in four segments as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\) and those of U's as \\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\\). Therefore, the following equations hold:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8,\n\\]\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 8.\n\\]\nWe need to assign values to these segments such that each segment has at least one movement (to ensure they are non-empty). Each segment must be positive.\n\n### Step 3: Using transformations\nTo simplify our calculations, we can change the variables by setting:\n\\[\nx_i = a_i - 1 \\quad (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_i = b_i - 1 \\quad (i = 1, 2, 3, 4),\n\\]\nwhich allows us to rewrite the equations as:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 4,\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 4.\n\\]\nNow, \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) must be non-negative integers.\n\n### Step 4: Counting non-negative integer solutions\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations can be determined using the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial method. \n\nFor the equation \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 4\\), the number of solutions is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35.\n\\]\nSimilarly, for the equation \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 4\\), we get the same number of solutions:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = 35.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Combining results\nSince the selections of R's and U's are independent, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the number of paths of length 16 on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid that change direction exactly four times is \\(\\boxed{1225}\\).",

The paths that change direction exactly four times can be represented in groups.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Paths\nWith 4 changes in direction, the 16 total moves can be divided into groups of Rs and Us. Given that there are 4 segments created by the direction changes, we will denote the lengths of these segments as:\n- \\(a\\) Right moves in the first segment\n- \\(b\\) Up moves in the first segment\n- \\(c\\) Right moves in the second segment\n- \\(d\\) Up moves in the second segment\n- \\(e\\) Right moves in the third segment\n- \\(f\\) Up moves in the third segment\n- \\(g\\) Right moves in the fourth segment\n- \\(h\\) Up moves in the fourth segment\n\nHowever, since we strictly need paths with alternating segments, the segments must strictly alternate, ultimately causing us to link R's and U's in pairs.\n\n### Step 3: Arrangement of Moves\nFollowing our needs, every direction change means we evaluate these segments in the form of pairs:\n- R (moves) must equal an Up (moves) since we need to land back on the grid: \n   - Following the pairs, we can set up lengths such that the sum of Rs equals 8, and the sum of Us also equals 8.\n- Each segment contributes to a direction change, thus we order them:\n\nGiven the requirement that we change direction 4 times (the initial direction does not count)— this means each segment can be strictly alternating R and U or U and R (such as RU or UR).\n\n### Step 4: Assign Lengths\nIf we arrange it this way, a valid way of accomplishing this is taking pairs with lengths:\n1. Two horizontal segments of Rs followed by two vertical segments of Us.\n2.

A change from U to R counts as another direction change.\n\nIf there are 4 changes, there are then 5 segments of moves (each segment can be purely R's or U's). Thus, we can represent the segments as:\n- Segment 1: \\(x_1\\) R's\n- Segment 2: \\(y_1\\) U's\n- Segment 3: \\(x_2\\) R's\n- Segment 4: \\(y_2\\) U's\n- Segment 5: \\(x_3\\) R's (the last segment of R's)\n- Segment 6: \\(y_3\\) U's (the last segment of U's)\n\n### Step 3: Constraints\nWe need the following constraints to hold true for the total movements:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total R's)}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total U's)}\n\\]\nFurthermore, all \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\) should be positive integers to ensure that we actually change direction and do not have any immediate consecutive R's or U's (hence ensuring a change).\n\n### Step 4: Variable Substitution\nTo handle the positive integer constraint, we can use a change of variables:\nLet \\(x_1' = x_1 - 1\\), \\(x_2' = x_2 - 1\\), \\(x_3' = x_3 - 1\\) (so that \\(x_i' \\geq 0\\)). This leads to:\n\\[\nx_1' + x_2' + x_3' = 5\n\\]\nSimilarly for U’s:\n\\[\ny_1' + y_2' + y_3' = 5\n\\]\nNow we need to count the non-negative integer solutions to these equations.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Stars and Bars Theorem\nAccording to the stars and bars theorem, the number of non-negative solutions to the equation \\(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k = n\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\nFor each of our equations (R's and U's):\n\n1. For \\(x_1' + x_2' + x_3' = 5\\):\n   - Number of solutions: \n   \\[\n   \\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{7}{2} = 21\n   \\]\n\n2.

Under the condition of having exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, we need:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nu_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4 + u_5 = 8\n\\]\n\nEach \\( r_i \\) and \\( u_j \\) for \\( i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\) is a positive integer since the path needs to change direction, so each segment must contain at least one move in that direction.\n\n### Step 4: Transforming to Non-Negative Integers\nTo convert these equations into a form that can be worked with using the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial method, we can do the following:\nDefine \\( x_i = r_i - 1 \\) and \\( y_j = u_j - 1 \\) for \\( i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\). This ensures each segment has at least one move:\n- Then \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n- And \\( y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 = 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Applying Stars and Bars\nNow, we apply the stars and bars theorem to find the non-negative integer solutions to these equations. \n\nFor \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 3 \\):\nThe number of solutions is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} = \\binom{3 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n\\]\n\nFor \\( y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 = 3 \\):\nSimilarly, the number of solutions is:\n\\[\n\\binom{3 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Total Combinations\nThe total number of paths that change direction exactly 4 times is the product of the number of ways to distribute the R's and the U's:\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1225}\n\\]",

For the paths to change direction exactly 4 times, a combination of R and U must occur in segments. Each direction change corresponds to finishing one segment and starting another, leading to an even number of segments — for four changes, this means there must be 5 segments (as the number of segments is always one more than the number of changes).\n\n### Step 3: Configuring the Segments\nTo make 5 segments with 4 changes, we can define them as:\n- \\(a_1\\): the number of R's in the first segment,\n- \\(b_1\\): the number of U's in the first segment,\n- \\(a_2\\): the number of R's in the second segment,\n- \\(b_2\\): the number of U's in the second segment,\n- \\(a_3\\): the number of R's in the third segment,\n- \\(b_3\\): the number of U's in the third segment,\n- \\(a_4\\): the number of R's in the fourth segment,\n- \\(b_4\\): the number of U's in the fourth segment, and\n- \\(a_5\\): the number of R's in the fifth segment,\n- \\(b_5\\): the number of U's in the fifth segment.\n\nThe sum of all R's must equal 8 and the sum of all U's must also equal 8:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 + b_5 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Counting Distributions of Segments\nWe can apply the \"stars and bars\" theorem to count the number of ways to distribute the moves.

Changing direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. A path changing direction exactly four times implies that it alternates between moving down one of the two directions (R or U) four times. \n\n### Step 2: Pattern of directions\nBy changing direction four times, we have a specific pattern of movements. For four changes, the path can be divided into five segments:\n\n1. Segment 1 (first direction),\n2. Segment 2 (second direction),\n3. Segment 3 (third direction),\n4. Segment 4 (fourth direction),\n5. Segment 5 (final direction).\n\n### Step 3: Assign counts to segments\nGiven there are four changes in direction, we'll assign a number \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\) to represent the number of moves in each of the segments. The crucial constraint here is that:\n\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 16\n\\]\n\nMoreover, since we need 8 Rs and 8 Us, we must consider how many segments consist of Rs and how many consist of Us. We denote 'R' segments and 'U' segments. The segments can be arranged in two alternating patterns, starting with either R or U.\n\nLet’s analyze the scenarios:\n\n- Start with R: \\(R, U, R, U, R\\) through segments \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\) respectively, where three segments are Rs and two segments are Us.\n- Start with U: \\(U, R, U, R, U\\) through segments \\(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5\\) respectively, where three segments are Us and two segments are Rs.\n\n### Step 4: Set values for R and U counts\nIf we choose the start pattern as \\(R, U, R, U, R\\), we have:\n- \\(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 = 8\\) (total R moves),\n- \\(a_2 + a_4 = 8\\) (total U moves).\n\nConversely, for the pattern starting with U, we have:\n- \\(b_2 + b_4 + b_5 = 8\\) (total U moves),\n- \\(b_1 + b_3 = 8\\) (total R moves).\n\n### Step 5: Count arrangements\nNotice, every arrangement of Rs and Us that satisfies the above conditions is valid as long as we fulfill the segment conditions. \n\nWe can find valid combinations:\n\n1. **For the pattern \\(R, U, R, U, R\\)**, let's set:\n   - Assign number of Rs to the positions and number of Us respectively and calculate:\n   \n   Let's denote \\(x_1 = a_1\\), \\(x_2 = a_2\\), \\(x_3 = a_3\\), \\(x_4 = a_4\\), and \\(x_5 = a_5\\).

Hence, a complete path has a total of 16 steps, comprising 8 \\(R\\)s and 8 \\(U\\)s.\n\n2. **Change of Direction**: Changing direction means switching from moving \\(R\\) to \\(U\\) or vice versa.

Therefore, each valid path consists of a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's, for a total of 16 moves.\n\n### Step 2: Changing Direction\nChanging direction means switching from R to U or from U to R. To count paths that change direction exactly four times, we need to think about how to arrange the R's and U's.\n\nEach time we change direction, we effectively form a segment of R's followed by a segment of U's. If there are four direction changes, there will be five segments in total.\n\n### Step 3: Segments\nLet’s denote the segments as:\n\n- \\(a_1\\): number of R's in the first segment,\n- \\(b_1\\): number of U's in the first segment,\n- \\(a_2\\): number of R's in the second segment,\n- \\(b_2\\): number of U's in the second segment,\n- \\(a_3\\): number of R's in the third segment,\n- \\(b_3\\): number of U's in the third segment,\n- \\(a_4\\): number of R's in the fourth segment,\n- \\(b_4\\): number of U's in the fourth segment.\n\n### Step 4: Counting Constraints\nThe total number of R's must equal 8, and the total number of U's must also equal 8, leading us to the equations:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8,\n\\]\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 8.\n\\]\nEach segment must contain at least one R or one U (to ensure there are direction changes), so we can define:\n\\[\na_1', a_2', a_3', a_4' \\text{ and } b_1', b_2', b_3', b_4'\n\\]\nas \\(a_i = a_i' + 1\\) and \\(b_i = b_i' + 1\\), where \\(a_i' \\geq 0\\) and \\(b_i' \\geq 0\\). This adjustment accounts for the minimum of one R and one U per segment.\n\n### Step 5: Adjusting for Segments\nSubstituting this into our equations, we obtain:\n\\[\n(a_1' + 1) + (a_2' + 1) + (a_3' + 1) + (a_4' + 1) = 8,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\na_1' + a_2' + a_3' + a_4' = 4.\n\\]\nSimilarly for \\(b\\):\n\\[\nb_1' + b_2' + b_3' + b_4' = 4.\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Using Stars and Bars\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = n\\) is given by the \"stars and bars\" combinatorial method:\n\\[\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1},\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of stars, and \\(k\\) is the number of segments.\n\nFor our cases of \\(a_i'\\) and \\(b_i'\\):\n\\[\n\\text{For } a_i': \\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{For } b_i': \\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35.\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Total Paths\nThe total number of configurations of the paths that change direction exactly four times is the product of the number of valid combinations for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225.\n\\]\nThus, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \\(\\boxed{1225}\\).",

Thus, any complete path has a total of \\(16\\) steps (8 up + 8 right).\n\n### Step 2: Direction Changes\n\nThe condition of changing direction exactly four times implies that we can segment the sequence of R's and U's into combinations where directions shift from R to U or U to R. In a possible path that changes direction the first time at \\(i_1\\), the second time at \\(i_2\\), and so on, we denote segments between the direction changes.\n\nAssuming we start with R, our path could look like:\n\n- \\(R^{n_1} U^{m_1} R^{n_2} U^{m_2} R^{n_3} U^{m_3} R^{n_4} U^{m_4}\\)\n\nwhere \\(n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 = 8\\) and \\(m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 = 8\\). \n\n### Step 3: Setting Up for Solutions\n\nSince there are 4 transitions (where we switch from R to U or vice versa), we actually divide the \\(8\\) R's and \\(8\\) U's into \\(4\\) segments. This means we can assign \\(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4\\) to be the lengths of the R segments and \\(m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4\\) to be the lengths of the U segments. These must all be positive integers since they represent lengths of segments.\n\n### Step 4: Transform to Non-negative Solutions\n\nTo manage the conditions that \\(n_i\\) and \\(m_i\\) must all be greater than \\(0\\), we perform a substitution:\n\n\\[\nx_i = n_i - 1 \\quad (i = 1, ..., 4)\n\\]\n\\[\ny_i = m_i - 1 \\quad (i = 1, ..., 4)\n\\]\n\nThis transforms our equations to:\n\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 4 \\quad (\\text{where } x_i \\geq 0)\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 4 \\quad (\\text{where } y_i \\geq 0)\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Counting Non-negative Solutions\n\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 4\\) (using stars and bars) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the \\(y\\) values, giving us another \\(35\\) solutions.\n\n### Step 6: Total Paths\n\nSince the choices for \\(n\\) segments and \\(m\\) segments are independent, we multiply the number of each:\n\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths of length \\(16\\) that change direction exactly \\(4\\) times is \\(\\boxed{1225}\\).",

A total of \\(16\\) moves is thus required in any valid path to traverse this grid.\n\n### Step 2: Direction Changes\nIn this context, a direction change occurs when we switch from moving in one direction (R or U) to the other. The problem requests paths that change direction exactly \\(4\\) times. \n\n### Step 3: Direction Blocks\nWith \\(4\\) changes in direction, we can divide the \\(R\\) and \\(U\\) moves into \\(5\\) consecutive blocks. For instance, a path might look something like:\n\n\\[ RRRRUUUURRRRUUUU \\]\n\nThis is just one arrangement but can be broken down more generally into segments of R's and U's totaling to \\(8R\\) and \\(8U\\) moves.\n\n### Step 4: Representing Direction Changes\nTo ensure there are exactly \\(4\\) changes of direction, we can represent these segments as \\( R_1, U_1, R_2, U_2, R_3, U_3, R_4, U_4 \\), such that:\n- \\( |R_1| + |R_2| + |R_3| + |R_4| = 8 \\)\n- \\( |U_1| + |U_2| + |U_3| + |U_4| = 8 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Assign Values to Blocks\nSince there are \\(4\\) blocks of Rs and \\(4\\) blocks of Us, each block of Rs (or Us) must contain at least \\(1\\) move (so there is a valid direction to move). To manage the situation, we can assign \\(1\\) move to each \\(R_i\\) and \\(U_i\\), ensuring that it respects the grid structure while allowing for the remaining moves to be distributed.\n\n### Step 6: Adjusting for Remaining Moves and Generating Combinations\nAfter assigning \\(1\\) move to each block, we have used up \\(4R\\) and \\(4U\\) from the total of \\(8R\\) and \\(8U\\). This leaves us with \\(4R\\) and \\(4U\\) left to distribute freely among \\(4\\) blocks.\n\nUsing a combinatorial method called \"stars and bars\", we can find the number of ways to distribute \\(4\\) remaining moves among \\(4\\) blocks for Rs and \\(4\\) blocks for Us.

Therefore, if a path changes direction exactly four times, it consists of five segments:\n\n### Step 2: Structure of the Path\nEach segment can consist of either only R's or U's.

Therefore, the total length of such a path is \\(16\\).\n\n### Step 1: Direction Changes\n\nThe requirement is to have exactly \\(4\\) direction changes during the path. Each direction change occurs at the point of switching from one type of move (either R or U) to another.

The number of ways to distribute \\(6\\) (the leftover moves) into \\(2\\) groups (the segments of Rs and Us) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{7}{1} = 7\n\\]\n\nSince we have two groups, we solve each equation independently:\n- \"Rs\": \\(6\\) can be split into \\(2\\) segments, so we have \\(\\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \\binom{7}{1} = 7\\) ways.\n- \"Us\": Same as above, yielding another \\(7\\) distributions.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results\n\nThus, the total configurations for choosing \\((S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4)\\):\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 7 = 49\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Counting Path Arrangements\n\nThe segments can be arranged in \\(4!\\) different orderings (since we have four segments), but we over-counted because we regard segments like  \\(S_1, S_3\\) to be indistinguishable (they are both R's), and likewise for \\(S_2, S_4\\) (they are both U's). Therefore, the correct ordering adjustment is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = 6\n\\]\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSo, the final count of paths is given by multiplying configurations with orderings:\n\\[\n49 \\times 6 = 294\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths that change direction exactly \\(4\\) times while moving from the lower left to the upper right corner of the grid is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{294}\n\\]",

The pattern will look like:\n\n- \\(R_1U_1R_2U_2\\)\n- \\(R_3U_3R_4U_4\\)\n\nWhere \\(R_1, U_1, R_2, U_2, R_3, U_3, R_4, U_4\\) are the lengths of the segments of right and up moves that must add to 8 for right moves and to 8 for up moves.\n\n### Step 3: Configuring the Segments\nLet’s denote \\(R_i\\) as the number of right moves in the \\(i^{th}\\) R segment, and \\(U_i\\) the number of up moves in \\(i^{th}\\) U segment:\n\nWe need the following conditions to hold:\n\\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 = 8 \\]\n\\[ U_1 + U_2 + U_3 + U_4 = 8 \\]\n\nEach segment must have at least one move to meet the change of direction requirement. Thus, we can set:\n\\[ R_i' = R_i - 1, \\text{ for } i=1,2,3,4 \\]\n\\[ U_i' = U_i - 1, \\text{ for } i=1,2,3,4 \\]\n\nWhere \\(R_i'\\) and \\(U_i'\\) are non-negative integers representing the extra moves after ensuring each segment has one move.\n\n### Step 4: Reformulating the Equations\nThis gives us the following reformed equations:\n\\[ (R_1' + 1) + (R_2' + 1) + (R_3' + 1) + (R_4' + 1) = 8 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ R_1' + R_2' + R_3' + R_4' = 4 \\]\n\nAnd similarly for the U moves:\n\\[ U_1' + U_2' + U_3' + U_4' = 4 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Solutions\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = n \\) can be calculated using the \"stars and bars\" theorem, yielding:\n\\[\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total (4 in this case) and \\(k\\) is the number of variables (also 4).\n\nThus, we count:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions for } R: \\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions for } U: \\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Total Paths\nFinally, each combination of right moves and up moves corresponds to a unique path.

Therefore, any valid path consists of 8 R's and 8 U's, leading to a total of 16 moves.\n\nThe requirement of changing direction exactly four times implies that our path must alternate between moves in the horizontal (R) and vertical (U) directions, resulting in segments where moves are made in one direction before switching to the other. \n\n### Structure of the Path\nIf we change direction exactly four times, it means we transition from R to U and back four times.

Thus, any valid path will consist of 16 moves in total with 8 R's and 8 U's.\n\n2. **Specifying the Direction Changes**:\n   We want paths that change direction exactly four times. Formally, we can define a segment of the path as a continuous set of either R's or U's. For example, the sequence \"RRUUUURRRR\" changes direction between segments and counts as different changes.\n\n   Since we need to change direction 4 times, we can represent the path as alternating sequences of R's and U's.

If a path changes direction exactly four times, it can be broken down into segments of contiguous R's and U's in such a way that there are four segments in total.\n\nFor instance, a valid sequence might look like:\n- RRUU\n- UURR\n- RRURUU\n\nGiven that we go from R to U or U to R, we can observe that the four changes imply we can have the path in the following format:\n- R segment, U segment, R segment, U segment, R segment, U segment.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Segment Distribution\nTo meet the requirement of 4 changes, we can denote the segments in the following way based on the sequence of movements:\n- \\(x_1\\): number of R's in the first segment\n- \\(y_1\\): number of U's in the first segment\n- \\(x_2\\): number of R's in the second segment\n- \\(y_2\\): number of U's in the second segment\n- \\(x_3\\): number of R's in the third segment\n- \\(y_3\\): number of U's in the third segment\n- \\(x_4\\): number of R's in the fourth segment\n- \\(y_4\\): number of U's in the fourth segment\n\nWe then have the constraints:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8,\n\\]\n\\[\ny_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 8,\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_i \\geq 1\\) and \\(y_i \\geq 1\\) for \\(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\\).

The total number of U's across segments must equal \\( 8 \\).\n\nSince the path starts at the bottom left (0,0), it must start with either an R or a U. Without loss of generality, let's assume it starts with R. The sequence of segments can then be represented as:\n- \\( R^{X_1} \\)\n- \\( U^{Y_1} \\)\n- \\( R^{X_2} \\)\n- \\( U^{Y_2} \\)\n- \\( R^{X_3} \\) (ends with U's)\n\nThis means we must have:\n\\[\nX_1 + X_2 + X_3 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total R's)}\n\\]\n\\[\nY_1 + Y_2 = 8 \\quad \\text{(total U's)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Using Stars and Bars\nWe can find the number of non-negative integer solutions to these equations via the “stars and bars” theorem.\n\n1. **For R's**: We need to find the number of solutions to \\( X_1 + X_2 + X_3 = 8 \\). Using stars-and-bars:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of solutions} = \\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45.\n   \\]\n\n2. **For U's**: Here, we need to find the number of solutions to \\( Y_1 + Y_2 = 8 \\).

Since we move from (0,0) to (8,8), a complete path consists of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, which sums to 16 moves.\n\nThe requirement of changing direction exactly four times can be interpreted as a series of segments where the path remains in one direction (either all R's or all U's) before switching to the other direction.

If the path changes direction exactly four times, there will be five segments in the path (since the first segment starts in one direction). \n\n### Step 2: Segment Distribution\nThe four changes in direction can divide the path into segments of moves in each direction (either U or R):\n- Let’s denote the number of right moves in the \\(i^{th}\\) segment as \\(r_i\\) (where \\(i\\) is 1 to 5) and the number of up moves as \\(u_i\\). \n- Each \\(r_i\\) and \\(u_i\\) should be non-negative and should sum to 8, respectively, for a valid path.\n\nThe following relationships must hold:\n\\[\nr_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nu_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4 + u_5 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Conditions on the Segments\nFor the path to change direction exactly four times, the segments will alternate between R and U:\n- Assign directions: if we start with R, it will follow the pattern R-U-R-U-R-U.\n- The number of segments (R or U) are fixed: three segments will correspond to R (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5) and two segments to U (i.e., indices 2, 4) or vice versa.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Distributions\nLet \\(r_1, r_3, r_5\\) be the segments with right moves and \\(u_2, u_4\\) be those with up moves. The path changes can come in two forms:\n1. R-U-R-U-R (3 R's first)\n2. U-R-U-R-U (3 U's first)\n\nFor the case of starting with R:\n1. **Choosing Counts from R’s Segments**: We need to distribute \\(8\\) right moves across \\(3\\) segments \\( (r_1, r_3, r_5) \\):\n   - Non-negative solutions to \\( r_1 + r_3 + r_5 = 8 \\) can be computed as follows using stars and bars:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Choosing Counts from U’s Segments**: Similarly, for the \\(2\\) up segments \\( (u_2, u_4) \\):\n   - Non-negative solutions to \\( u_2 + u_4 = 8 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{8+2-1}{2-1} = \\binom{9}{1} = 9\n   \\]\n\nThus, for this case (starting with R), the total number of paths is \\( 45 \\cdot 9 = 405 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Accounting for Starting with U\nBy symmetry, the case starting with U will yield the same number of paths:\n- Therefore, the total paths is also \\( 405 \\).\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nAdding these two cases together, we get:\n\\[\n405 + 405 = 810\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is \\(\\boxed{810}\\).",

Therefore, any such path has a total of length 16, consisting of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U).\n\n### Step 2: Direction Changes\nThe problem specifies that the paths change direction exactly four times. A direction change can be defined as switching from moving right (R) to moving up (U) or vice versa. A sequence of movements in paths can be represented as a string of Rs and Us.\n\nFor a path to have exactly four direction changes, we follow these considerations:\n- The path must consist of exactly four segments of consecutive Rs or Us.\n- The segments can be arranged in different configurations such as RRUU, UURR, and so on.\n\n### Step 3: Required Segments\nSince there are 16 moves total, and we need exactly four segments, we can denote the lengths of the segments.

This means we will actually have two sets of distributions:\n1. Distribution of the R segments among the four groups.\n2. Distribution of the U segments among the four groups.\n\nThe Euclidean formula for distributing \\(n\\) indistinguishable objects into \\(k\\) distinguishable boxes (where boxes can be empty) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Formula\nFor \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8\\):\n- Here, \\(n = 8\\) (the total right moves) and \\(k = 4\\) (the segments):\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to distribute Rs} = \\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{11}{3}\n\\]\n\nFor \\(y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 8\\):\n- Similarly,\n\\[\n\\text{Ways to distribute Us} = \\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{11}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Combinations\nFirst, compute the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{990}{6} = 165\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Total Configurations\nSince the selections of Rs and Us are independent, the total number of paths that fit the criterion becomes a product of both distributions:\n\\[\n\\text{Total paths} = \\binom{11}{3} \\times \\binom{11}{3} = 165 \\times 165 = 27225\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is \\(\\boxed{27225}\\).",

Each segment will consist of a series of 'R's or 'U's followed by a switch to the other direction. \n\n### Step 2: Determine the Segment Structure\nSince there are 4 changes in direction, the path will consist of 5 segments.

Each segment will consist of either R's or U's, for example:\n\n- Segment 1: R's\n- Segment 2: U's\n- Segment 3: R's\n- Segment 4: U's\n- Segment 5: R's or U's\n\nGiven the requirement to have equal numbers of R's and U's (8 each), we can denote the lengths of these segments as follows:\n\n- Let \\(x_1\\) be the length of the first segment (number of R's),\n- Let \\(y_1\\) be the length of the second segment (number of U's),\n- Let \\(x_2\\) be the length of the third segment,\n- Let \\(y_2\\) be the length of the fourth segment,\n- Let \\(x_3\\) be the length of the last segment.\n\nWhere \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8\\) (total R's) and \\(y_1 + y_2 = 8\\) (total U's).\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Variables\n\nBased on the structure, \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) must be non-negative integers, and \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) must also be non-negative. This leads to:\n\n1. The equation \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8\\)\n2. The equation \\(y_1 + y_2 = 8\\)\n\nFrom \\(y_1 + y_2 = 8\\), we can express one variable in terms of the other. Assume \\(y_1 = k\\) and therefore \\(y_2 = 8 - k\\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\)\n\nTo explore the values for \\(k\\), \\(y_1\\) can take values from 0 to 8, which gives us 9 possible ways to choose \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\). \n\n### Step 4: Counting \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\)\n\nFor each fixed \\(k\\):\n\n- We need to find the composition of \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) such that \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8\\). This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem in combinatorics, where the number of non-negative integer solutions can be calculated using:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total (8) and \\(k\\) is the number of variables (3):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of solutions to } x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 8 = \\binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{10}{2} = 45\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total Paths with Fixed Directions\n\nNow we need to aggregate both counts (the choice of \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) along with \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\)):\n\n- For each fixed \\(k\\), we have 9 choices for \\(k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 8\\).\n- Each configuration of \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) is 45. \n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total configurations} = 9 \\times 45 = 405\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of paths on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid that change direction exactly four times is therefore \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{405}\n\\]",

Thus, a valid path in terms of R's and U's will have a total of 16 moves:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Path} = R^8 U^8\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Count Direction Changes\nA path that changes direction exactly 4 times alternates between moving right and moving up, hence we can denote the segments between the direction changes. Since we need to have 4 direction changes, they will divide the path into 5 segments. Each segment will contain a series of R's followed by U's or U's followed by R's.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Segments\nLet's denote:\n- \\(a_1\\): Number of R's in the first segment\n- \\(b_1\\): Number of U's in the first segment\n- \\(a_2\\), \\(b_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(b_3\\), etc., for the subsequent segments.\n\nAfter the 4 direction changes, we create segments that consist of the following sequence: \n1. Right (R)\n2. Up (U)\n3. Right (R)\n4. Up (U)\n5. Right (R) or Up (U)\n\nTo satisfy the total of 8 R's and 8 U's, we can represent the segments as follows:\n- Segment 1: \\(a_1\\) R’s and \\(b_1\\) U’s.\n- Segment 2: \\(a_2\\) R’s and \\(b_2\\) U’s.\n- Segment 3: \\(a_3\\) R’s and \\(b_3\\) U’s.\n- Segment 4: \\(a_4\\) R’s and \\(b_4\\) U’s.\n\nWe must alternate between R's and U's, hence the series looks like:\n- R's, U's, R's, U's, R's, U's\n\n### Step 4: Set Equations\nWe set the following equations from the segments to account for all R's and U's:\n\\[\na_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nb_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 8\n\\]\nwith the constraint that every \\(a_i \\geq 1\\) and \\(b_i \\geq 1\\) due to needing at least one R and one U in each segment.\n\n### Step 5: Change of Variables\nTo simplify our problem, let’s change variables by letting \\(c_i = a_i - 1\\) and \\(d_i = b_i - 1\\) where \\(c_i \\geq 0\\) and \\(d_i \\geq 0\\). The equations now look like:\n\n\\[\n(c_1 + 1) + (c_2 + 1) + (c_3 + 1) + (c_4 + 1) = 8 \\implies c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n(d_1 + 1) + (d_2 + 1) + (d_3 + 1) + (d_4 + 1) = 8 \\implies d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Apply Stars and Bars\nNow we count the number of non-negative integer solutions to each equation using the \"stars and bars\" theorem.\n\nFor \\(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 4\\), the number of solutions is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\nThe same calculation applies for \\(d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{3} = 35\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Combine Results\nSince the choices for \\(c_i\\) and \\(d_i\\) are independent, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:\n\n\\[\n35 \\times 35 = 1225\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1225}\n\\]",

Hence, the overall path length is \\(16\\), made up of 8 R's and 8 U's.\n\n2. **Changing Directions**: Changing direction corresponds to switching from moving in one direction to the other. If there are 4 total direction changes in a path, this means we have sequences of movements with respect to R's and U's where the path alternates between the two directions.\n\n3. **Pattern of Directions**: If we represent a sequence of movements as \\(R\\) and \\(U\\), with exactly 4 changes in direction, the pattern could resemble:\n   - RRRRRRUUUUUU (0 changes)\n   - RRRRRRURUUUUU (1 change)\n   - RRRRURRRRUUUU (2 changes)\n   - RRUUURRRRUUUU (3 changes)\n   - UUUUUURRRRRR (4 changes)\n\n   Every time we change direction, we are virtually creating ‘blocks’ of R's or U's. With exactly 4 direction changes, we will have 5 such segments (blocks) where paths may be represented, for example, in the form \\( R^{n_1} U^{m_1} R^{n_2} U^{m_2} R^{n_3} U^{m_3} R^{n_4} U^{m_4} \\) with \\( n_i \\) representing the count of R's in each block and \\( m_i \\) representing the count of U's in each block.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Count**: For the path to have exactly 4 changes in direction, it must consist of 5 segments of R's and U's such that they completely use up 8 moves in R's and 8 moves in U's. Hence, we arrange 5 blocks of R's and U's as follows where \\( n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 = 8 \\) and \\( m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8 \\). \n\n5. **Distributing the Moves**: This distribution can be calculated using stars and bars for distributing the segments.

Each \\( n_i \\) must be at least 1, so we set \\( n_i' = n_i - 1 \\geq 0 \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   n_1' + n_2' + n_3' + n_4' + n_5' = 3\n   \\]\n   The number of non-negative integer solutions is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3 + 5 - 1}{5 - 1} = \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n   \\]\n   \n   The same argument applies for \\( m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5 \\) for U’s:\n   \\[\n   m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8,\n   \\]\n   leading also to:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{7}{4} = 35\n   \\]\n\n7. **Final Counting**: Now multiply the two distributions:\n\\[\n35 \\text{ (for R's)} \\times 35 \\text{ (for U's)} = 1225.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer, which counts the number of paths that change direction exactly four times while traversing an \\( 8 \\times 8 \\) grid, is given by:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1225}.\n\\]",

A change in direction occurs when we switch from moving right to moving up or vice versa. For a path to change direction exactly 4 times, we can identify segments of movement:\n\n1. Let's represent the path in segments denoted as the number of upward and rightward moves in each segment. \n2.

The counts of segments can be designated as follows: if the number of segments is 5, and we have \\(k_1\\) R's and \\(m_1\\) U's in the first segment, \\(k_2\\) R's and \\(m_2\\) U's in the second segment, and so forth, we have:\n   \\[\n   k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 + k_5 = 8 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 8.\n   \\]\n   Each segment can start with either R or U, but since we only have 4 changes, the first segment will have to be either R's or U's, and we must alternate afterward.\n\n4. **Valid Segment Compositions**: To maintain the property of changing direction exactly four times, the valid sequences will look like:\n   - Starting with R:  (R U R U R U R U)\n   - Starting with U:  (U R U R U R U R)\n\n   Therefore, we have two cases to consider based on the first segment.\n\n5. **Distributing Moves**:\n   - In the first case (starting with R), let's define the lengths of segments as:\n     - \\(k_1, m_1, k_2, m_2, k_3\\)\n   - Where all odd indexed segments correspond to R and even indexed segments to U.\n   - Similarly apply for when it starts with U (the even/odd indices will switch).\n\n   **Example Counting**: \n   For a sequence starting with R,\n   \\[\n   x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 8 \\quad (x_1, x_3, x_5 = k's: \\text{R's}) \\text{ and } (x_2, x_4 = m's: \\text{U's})\n   \\]\n   leading to:\n   \\[\n   y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 + y_5 = 8 \\quad (y_1, y_3, y_5 = m's: \\text{U's})\n   \\]\n   \n6. **Using Stars and Bars**: \n\n   The distributions of \\( k\\)'s and \\( m\\)'s for \\(8\\) R's with \\(5\\) groups can be calculated using the \"stars and bars\" theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ways to distribute \\(8\\) R's in \\(5\\) segments} = \\binom{8+5-1}{5-1} = \\binom{12}{4} = 495\n   \\]\n   Same with \\(8\\) U's in \\(5\\) segments, gives also \\(495\\).\n\n   Therefore, for each starting scenario (R or U following swaps), we take the product:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total for both cases} = 495 \\times 495 = 245025.\n   \\]\n\nFinally, adding for the scenario starting with either R or U (total \\(2\\) paths):\n\\[\n\\text{Final Answer} = 245025 + 245025 = 490050.\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of paths of length \\(16\\) from (0,0) to (8,8) changing direction exactly four times is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{245025}.\n\\]",

Each segment consists of either consecutive R's or consecutive U's.\n\nLet's denote the segments as follows:\n- Segment 1: A segment of R's\n- Segment 2: A segment of U's\n- Segment 3: A segment of R's\n- Segment 4: A segment of U's\n- Segment 5: A segment of R's or U's\n\nTo satisfy the requirement of precisely 4 changes in direction, the arrangement of segments should be as follows:\n\n1.

    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find paths on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid that move from the lower left corner to the upper right corner by taking steps either to the right (R) or up (U). Each path consists of a total of \\(8\\) right moves and \\(8\\) up moves, leading to a total path length of \\(16\\).\n\nWe also need to account for the constraint that these paths change direction exactly \\(4\\) times. A change in direction occurs at points where we switch from moving in one direction to moving in another. For instance, if a path goes from R to U or U to R, it counts as a change in direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Path Change Structure\nSince we want the path to change directions exactly \\(4\\) times:\n- Each path will consist of \\(4\\) segments.\n- This means that in total, we will have \\(4 + 1 = 5\\) segments of moves (since it starts with one direction and changes four times).\n\n### Step 2: Distribution of Moves\nLet’s denote the number of right moves (R) in the \\(i\\)-th segment by \\(R_i\\) and the number of up moves (U) in the \\(i\\)-th segment by \\(U_i\\). We have the following conditions:\n- Each segment contributes either an R segment or a U segment.\n- The overall number of right moves must equal \\(8\\):\n  \\[\n  R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 = 8\n  \\]\n- The overall number of up moves must equal \\(8\\):\n  \\[\n  U_1 + U_2 + U_3 + U_4 = 8\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Arrangement of Segments\nSince there are \\(4\\) changes in direction implying \\(5\\) total segments, we can have the following pattern distributions either starting with R or U:\n1. RURU\n2. RURUR\n3. URUR\n4. URURU\n5. RURUU (and other permutations thereof)\n\n### Step 4: Counting Valid Arrangements\nWe need to partition \\(8\\) right moves and \\(8\\) up moves into \\(4\\) blocks alternating directions. The configuration alternates between R and U. Let us calculate for the two base patterns we can start with:\n- Starting with R gives segments: \\(R_1, U_1, R_2, U_2, R_3, U_3, R_4, U_4\\)\n- Starting with U gives segments: \\(U_1, R_1, U_2, R_2, U_3, R_3, U_4, R_4\\)\n\nEach configuration can be dealt with using the \"stars and bars\" theorem which provides a method to find the distribution of indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes.\n\n### Step 5: Stars and Bars Calculation\n#### Case 1: Configurations Starting with R\n- We need to place \\(8\\) stars (representing right moves) and \\(4 - 1 = 3\\) bars (to separate the \\(R_i\\)).\nThe number of ways to do this is:\n\\[\n\\binom{8 + 3}{3} = \\binom{11}{3}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Configurations Starting with U\nBy symmetry, the case where the segments start with U will yield the same result:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nNow \\( \\binom{11}{3} \\) can be calculated:\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{990}{6} = 165\n\\]\n\nThen since there are separate configurations for paths starting with R and U, the total paths with \\(4\\) direction changes can be given as:\n\\[\n2 \\times \\binom{11}{3} = 2 \\times 165 = 330\n\\]\n\nThe final result for paths that change direction exactly four times is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{330}\n\\]",
