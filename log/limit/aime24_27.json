For each maximum element \\( a_j \\) in \\( A \\), we can form nonempty subsets \\( B \\) whose maximum element is \\( a_j \\). The elements of \\( B \\) must consist of integers from the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_j\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting sets \\( B \\)\n\nFor a fixed maximum element \\( a_j \\), the number of finite nonempty subsets \\( B \\) that can be formed from \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_j\\} \\) where the maximum is \\( a_j \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Choose any subset from \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_j - 1\\} \\) (this accounts for all elements less than \\( a_j \\)).\n2. The subsets must include \\( a_j \\) itself.\n\nThe number of subsets of \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_j - 1\\} \\) is \\( 2^{a_j - 1} \\) (as each of the \\( a_j - 1 \\) elements can either be chosen or not chosen). Therefore, the number of valid sets \\( B \\) for the maximum \\( a_j \\) is\n\n\\[\n2^{a_j - 1}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Total Number of Sets \\( B \\)\n\nNow, if we let \\( N \\) denote the total number of sets \\( B \\) for all maximum elements in \\( A \\), we can express it as:\n\n\\[\nN = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} 2^{a_j - 1}.\n\\]\nWe know from the problem statement that \\( N = 2024 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing \\( N = 2024 \\)\n\nTo find suitable \\( a_j \\) integers, we first convert 2024 to its binary representation:\n\n\\[\n2024 = 11111100100_2.\n\\]\n\nTo express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2, we note:\n\n\\[\n2024 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8.\n\\]\n\nIn essence, 2024 can correspond to \\( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \\). \n\n### Step 5: Finding Possible Values of \\( a_j \\)\n\nTo satisfy \\( N = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} 2^{a_j - 1} \\):\n\n1. The values of \\( a_j \\) must be chosen such that \\( 2^{a_j - 1} \\) yields distinct powers summing to 2024.\n2.

First, we find \\( 2024 \\) in terms of its prime factorization:\n   \\[\n   2024 = 2^2 \\times 506 = 2^2 \\times 2 \\times 253 = 2^3 \\times 253 = 2^3 \\times 11 \\times 23\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the prime factorization is \\( 2^3 \\times 11 \\times 23 \\).\n\n6. **Defining Possible Values**:\n   The total number of subsets contributed by each \\( a_i \\) can be viewed as distinct powers of \\( 2 \\):\n   - Therefore, we express \\( 2024 = 2^{a_1 - 1} + 2^{a_2 - 1} + \\cdots + 2^{a_n - 1} \\) in a way that helps deduce the values of \\( a_i \\).\n\n7. **Trying Different Combinations**:\n   Examining combinations of sums:\n   \n   - Start with distinct non-negative integers representing powers of \\( 2 \\):\n\n     Suppose \\( n = 3 \\):\n     - Let \\( a_1 - 1 = 3 \\) (i.e., \\( a_1 = 4 \\))\n     - Let \\( a_2 - 1 = 2 \\) (i.e., \\( a_2 = 3 \\))\n     - Let \\( a_3 - 1 = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( a_3 = 1 \\))\n\n   Therefore, it stands as:\n   \\[\n   2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13\n   \\]\n\n   But this combination does not reach \\( 2024 \\).

Thus, the possible sets \\( B \\) can be formed by including any subset of \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_i-1\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Sets \\( B \\)\n\nThe number of subsets of \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, a_i-1\\} \\) is given by \\( 2^{a_i-1} \\) (since there are \\( a_i - 1 \\) elements available and each can either be included or excluded).\n\nThus, for a maximum element \\( a_i \\), the number of finite nonempty sets \\( B \\) whose maximum is \\( a_i \\) is \\( 2^{a_i-1} \\) because we have to exclude the empty set.\n\n### Step 3: Total Sets from Each Maximum in \\( A \\)\n\nThe total number of sets \\( B \\) in Bob's list, based on every maximum element in \\( A \\), is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i-1}\n\\]\n\nThis total must equal 2024:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2^{a_i-1} = 2024\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Break Down 2024 into Powers of 2\n\nTo understand how many terms contribute to this sum, we express 2024 in binary.\n\nTo convert 2024 into binary:\n\n1. \\( 2024 / 2 = 1012 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n2. \\( 1012 / 2 = 506 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n3. \\( 506 / 2 = 253 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n4. \\( 253 / 2 = 126 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n5. \\( 126 / 2 = 63 \\) remainder \\( 0 \\)\n6. \\( 63 / 2 = 31 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n7. \\( 31 / 2 = 15 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n8. \\( 15 / 2 = 7 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n9. \\( 7 / 2 = 3 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n10. \\( 3 / 2 = 1 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n11. \\( 1 / 2 = 0 \\) remainder \\( 1 \\)\n\nThis gives us the binary representation \\( 11111100100_2 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Powers of 2 in the Sum\n\nTo find how \\( 2024 \\) can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2, we interpret it as:\n\n\\[\n2024 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^6 + 2^7\n\\]\n\nWe can denote the exponents as:\n\n- \\( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^6, 2^7 \\) corresponds to \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128 \\)\n\n### Step 6: Finding \\( A \\)\n\nTo satisfy our equation, we can choose the elements of \\( A \\) as:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 2 \\) (contributes \\( 1 \\)),\n- \\( a_2 = 3 \\) (contributes \\( 2 \\)),\n- \\( a_3 = 4 \\) (contributes \\( 4 \\)),\n- \\( a_4 = 5 \\) (contributes \\( 8 \\)),\n- \\( a_5 = 6 \\) (contributes \\( 16 \\)),\n- \\( a_6 = 8 \\) (contributes \\( 64 \\)),\n- \\( a_7 = 9 \\) (contributes \\( 128 \\)).\n\nThis selection ensures we have \\( n = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 7: Summing Elements of \\( A \\)\n\nThe sum of the elements of \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\[\n2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 37\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{37}\n\\]",

So the number of valid subsets \\( B \\) for a fixed \\( m \\) is:\n\n\\[\n2^{m-1} - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting valid \\( B \\) for all \\( m \\in A \\)\n\nTo find the total number of sets \\( B \\) across all maximum elements in \\( A \\), we must sum this expression over all \\( m \\) in set \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\sum_{m \\in A} (2^{m-1} - 1)\n\\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = \\sum_{m \\in A} 2^{m-1} - \\sum_{m \\in A} 1 = \\sum_{m \\in A} 2^{m-1} - k\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of elements in \\( A \\).\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the equation\n\nWe know that Bob's list contains exactly \\( 2024 \\) sets \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m \\in A} 2^{m-1} - k = 2024\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m \\in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024 + k\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Exploring values of \\( m \\) and determining \\( A \\)\n\nLet's begin with simple integers in \\( A \\). We'll choose sets \\( A = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} \\) and calculate \\( \\sum_{m \\in A} 2^{m-1} \\).\n\nIf \\( A = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=1}^n 2^{m-1} = 2^n - 1\n\\]\n\nwhich gives:\n\\[\n2^n - 1 - n = 2024\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n2^n - n = 2025\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding \\( n \\)\n\nWe can evaluate this equation for small values of \\( n \\):\n\n- For \\( n = 10 \\): \n  \\[\n  2^{10} - 10 = 1024 - 10 = 1014 \\quad (\\text{too low})\n  \\]\n  \n- For \\( n = 11 \\):\n  \\[\n  2^{11} - 11 = 2048 - 11 = 2037 \\quad (\\text{too high})\n  \\]\n  \nNext, trying \\( n = 11 \\) implies \\( A = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 11\\} \\):\nWe have \\( \\{1, 2, \\dots, 11\\} \\):\n\\[\nk = 11 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{m=1}^{11} m = \\frac{11 \\cdot 12}{2} = 66\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Concluding\n\nThus, \\( \\sum_{m \\in A} = 66 \\).\nThe final answer, boxed, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]",
