So, Bob wins if Alice starts with 0 tokens.\n- **n = 1**: Alice can take the 1 token and win. Thus, \\( n = 1 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- **n = 2**: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, which is winning for him. Thus, \\( n = 2 \\) is a losing position for Alice (and winning for Bob).\n- **n = 3**: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob (losing for Bob), making \\( n = 3 \\) a winning position for Alice.\n- **n = 4**: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win outright. Thus, \\( n = 4 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- **n = 5**: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob (winning for Bob), thus making \\( n = 5 \\) a losing position for Alice.\n- **n = 6**: Alice can take 1 token (leaving 5) or 4 tokens (leaving 2). Since both moves lead to a losing position for Bob, \\( n = 6 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- **n = 7**: Alice can take 1 token (leaving 6) or 4 tokens (leaving 3). Both moves lead to winning positions for Bob, so \\( n = 7 \\) is a losing position for Alice.\n- **n = 8**: Alice can take 1 token (leaving 7) or 4 tokens (leaving 4). The first option leads to a losing position for Bob, so \\( n = 8 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- **n = 9**: Alice can leave 8 or 5, both winning for Bob, making \\( n = 9 \\) a losing position for Alice.\n- **n = 10**: Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 9) or 4 tokens (leaving 6). The first leads to a losing position for Bob, hence \\( n = 10 \\) is winning for Alice.\n- **n = 11**: Alice can leave 10 or 7. Both leave Bob in a winning position, so \\( n = 11 \\) is losing for Bob.\n- **n = 12**: Alice can leave 11 (losing position), so \\( n = 12 \\) is winning for Alice.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, we can observe a pattern in winning (W) and losing (L) positions:\n\n```\n0: L\n1: W\n2: L\n3: W\n4: W\n5: L\n6: W\n7: L\n8: W\n9: L\n10: W\n11: L\n12: W\n```\nContinuing this pattern, we can summarize:\n- Losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) (i.e., 0, 5, 10, 15, ...).\n\n### Step 2: Count the Losing Positions Up to 2024\n\nWe need to count how many multiples of 5 (losing positions) exist in the range \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 2024 \\). The sequence of losing positions under 2024 is given by:\n\n\\[\n5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020\n\\]\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where:\n- The first term \\( a = 5 \\)\n- The common difference \\( d = 5 \\)\n- The last term \\( l = 2020 \\)\n\nLet \\( k \\) be the number of terms in this sequence. The \\( k \\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nl = a + (k - 1)d\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n2020 = 5 + (k - 1)5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2015 = (k - 1)5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk - 1 = 403 \\implies k = 404\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees a win is \\( \\boxed{404} \\).",

A losing position is one where every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the base cases\n- **When \\( n = 1 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token and win. This is a winning position for Alice.\n- **When \\( n = 2 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 1. Bob then takes the last token and wins. This is a winning position for Alice.\n- **When \\( n = 3 \\)**: Similar to \\( n = 2 \\), if Alice takes 1 token, Bob wins by taking 2. If Alice takes both tokens (which is not allowed), Bob cannot lose. Thus, this is a winning position for Alice.\n- **When \\( n = 4 \\)**: Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. This is a winning position for Alice.\n- **When \\( n = 5 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob. Bob wins by taking all 4. This is a winning position for Bob.\n- **When \\( n = 6 \\)**: Similar to \\( n = 5 \\), if Alice takes 1, Bob will take 4 and win. So this is a winning position for Bob.\n- **When \\( n = 7 \\)**: If Alice takes 1 token, leaving 6, Bob wins by taking 4 in the next round; if Alice takes 4, leaving 3, Bob wins by taking 1 in the next round. This is a winning position for Bob.\n- **When \\( n = 8 \\)**: Alice can take any amount (1 or 4) and Bob will still have a return move that allows him to win eventually. Thus this is a losing position for Bob.\n\n### Step 2: Structure the winning and losing positions\nContinuing this reasoning will allow us to build a cycle of winning and losing positions. On analyzing further positions:\n\n- **Winning positions (W)**: \\( n = 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, \\ldots \\)\n- **Losing positions (L)**: \\( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, \\ldots \\)\n\n### Observing the pattern\nFrom the findings, we notice that losing positions seem to occur in intervals of 4 starting from 0:\n\n- \\( n = 0 \\) (not used, but conceptual)\n- \\( n = 4 \\)\n- \\( n = 8 \\)\n- \\( n = 12 \\)\n- \\( n = 16 \\)\n- \\( n = 20 \\)\n\nGenerally, the formula for losing positions appears to be:\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting applicable values\nTo find how many integers less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\) satisfy \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\):\n\nThe numbers that fit this condition in the range is \\( 4, 8, 12, \\ldots, 2024 \\).

If it’s your turn and there are no tokens left, you lose.\n2. **\\( n = 1 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take the last token and win.\n3. **\\( n = 2 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, which is a winning position for Alice.\n4. **\\( n = 3 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2, which is a winning position for her.\n5. **\\( n = 4 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take all 4 tokens and win.\n6. **\\( n = 5 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob (winning for Alice).\n7. **\\( n = 6 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5 for Bob (winning for Alice).\n8. **\\( n = 7 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 for Bob (winning for Alice).\n9. **\\( n = 8 \\)**: This is a winning position. Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 for Bob (winning for Alice).\n10. **\\( n = 9 \\)**: This is a losing position. Any move (1 or 4 tokens removed) leaves Bob in a winning position (8 or 5 respectively).\n11. **Continue analyzing further up to \\( n = 12 \\)**:\n   - \\( n = 10 \\): Winning (can leave 9)\n   - \\( n = 11 \\): Winning (can leave 10)\n   - \\( n = 12 \\): Winning (can leave 11)\n   - \\( n = 13 \\): Losing (can only leave 12 or 9)\n   \nAt this point, it's evident that if \\( n \\mod 5 = 0 \\) or \\( n \\mod 5 = 4 \\), these lead to losing positions for Bob when it's Alice's turn.\n\n### Step 2: General Pattern\n\nFrom our exploration, we deduce that every sequence of positions repeats every 5 numbers:\n- The losing positions are at: \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\).\n- Conversely, the winning positions are at: \\( n \\equiv 1 \\), \\( n \\equiv 2 \\), or \\( n \\equiv 4 \\mod 5 \\).\n\nExpected losing positions:\n- \\( 0, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16,... \\)\n  \n### Step 3: Counting\n\nWe want to count all the integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) that result in a losing position for Bob:\n- The losing positions identified were those where \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\) or \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\).\n\n#### Counting Up to 2024\n\n1. **For \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   n = 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\implies \\text{(last term) } 5k \\leq 2024 \\implies k \\leq 404\n   \\]\n\n2. **For \\( n \\equiv 3 \\mod 5 \\)**:\n   \\[\n   n = 3, 8, 13, \\ldots, 2023 \\implies \\text{(last term) } 5m + 3 \\leq 2024 \\implies 5m = 2020 \\implies m \\leq 404\n   \\]\n\nIn both cases, each case yields \\( 404 \\) valid integers.\n\nThus, total losing positions for Bob:\n\\[\n404 + 404 = 808\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is \\(\\boxed{808}\\).",

We will identify winning and losing positions for both players. A winning position is one from which the current player can force a win regardless of the opponent's responses, while a losing position is one where every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.\n\nWe define the states based on the number of tokens:\n\n- Let \\( W(n) \\) denote that the position with \\( n \\) tokens is a winning position for the player whose turn it is to play.\n- Let \\( L(n) \\) denote that the position with \\( n \\) tokens is a losing position for the player whose turn it is to play.\n\nWe can summarize the transitions as follows:\n- If \\( n \\) is a winning position, the player can move to an \\( L(n-1) \\) or \\( L(n-4) \\) position, ensuring a win.\n- Conversely, if all moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, \\( n \\) is a losing position.\n\nTo establish winning and losing positions, we evaluate the game for values of \\( n \\) starting from \\( 1 \\):\n\n1. \\( n = 1 \\): The player can take \\( 1 \\) token and win.

Thus, \\( n = 0 \\) is a losing position.\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): Alice can take the only token and win. So, \\( n = 1 \\) is a winning position.\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): Alice takes 1 token to leave Bob with 1, which is a winning position for Bob. Thus, \\( n = 2 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- For \\( n = 3 \\): Alice can take 1 token and leave Bob with 2 (a winning position for Bob), or take 4 tokens but that’s not possible here as \\( n < 4 \\). Therefore, Alice loses, making \\( n = 3 \\) a winning position for Alice.\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately.

Thus \\( n = 7 \\) is a winning position for Alice.\n- For \\( n = 8 \\): Alice can take all 4 tokens and win; thus, it's a winning position.\n- For \\( n = 9 \\): Alice must leave Bob a winning position (5) or a losing position (6). Therefore, Bob wins here. It is a losing position for Alice.\n- For \\( n = 10 \\): The best move for Alice is to leave Bob with a losing position (9), so \\( n = 10 \\) is winning.\n- Continuing this, we find for \\( n = 11 \\) that its strategy leads to winning positions as well.\n\n**Step 2: Pattern Recognition**\n\nAfter calculating several positions, we can categorize positions into winning (W) and losing (L):\n\n- \\( n = 0 \\) (L)\n- \\( n = 1 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 2 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 3 \\) (L)\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 5 \\) (L)\n- \\( n = 6 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 7 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 8 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 9 \\) (L)\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 11 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 12 \\) (W)\n- \\( n = 13 \\) (L)\n- \\( n = 14 \\) (W)\n- and so on...\n\nFrom this observed pattern and calculations, we can deduce that losing positions occur modulo 5.

Thus, 0 is a losing position (\"L\").\n   - If \\( n = 1 \\): Alice can take the last token, so 1 is a winning position (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 2 \\): Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. 2 is a losing position (\"L\").\n   - If \\( n = 3 \\): Alice removes 1 token, Bob faces 2 (which is losing for him), thus 3 is a winning position (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 4 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens, winning immediately. 4 is a winning position (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 5 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving Bob with 4 (winning for him).

So 7 is winning (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 8 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens to leave 4 (winning for Bob), hence 8 is also a winning position (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 9 \\): Alice takes 4 tokens, leaving 5 (which is a losing position for Bob), thus 9 is winning (\"W\").\n   - If \\( n = 10 \\): Alice can take 4 (leaving 6) or 1 (leaving 9), both positions are winning for her.

We define a position (i.e., a specific count of tokens) as losing if the player to move loses regardless of their move, provided the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\n### Step 1: Find Losing and Winning Positions\n- **Position 0**: If there are 0 tokens left (the person to play cannot make a move), they lose.

Both positions are winning, hence position 7 is losing: \\( L \\).\n- **Position 8**: The current player can remove 1 token (leaving 7, losing) or 4 tokens (leaving 4, winning).

    "response": "To determine the winning and losing positions in the game between Alice and Bob, we first need to analyze the position based on the number of tokens \\( n \\).\n\nThe game rules allow Alice and Bob to remove either 1 token or 4 tokens on each turn. A winning position for a player is one where they can make a move that forces their opponent into a losing position. Conversely, a losing position is one where every possible move puts the opponent in a winning position.\n\nWe can define losing positions as those where any move leads the opponent to a winning position. We designate a position as losing if there are no moves that result in the opponent being in a losing position.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze positions for small \\( n \\)\n\n1. **\\( n = 1 \\)**:\n   - Alice takes 1 token. Bob has no tokens left.\n   - **Winning Position for Alice**.\n\n2. **\\( n = 2 \\)**:\n   - Alice takes 1 token, leaving 1 token (winning position for Bob).\n   - **Winning Position for Alice**.\n\n3. **\\( n = 3 \\)**:\n   - Alice takes 1 token, leaving 2 tokens (winning position for Bob).\n   - **Winning Position for Alice**.\n\n4. **\\( n = 4 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 4 tokens and win.\n   - **Winning Position for Alice**.\n\n5. **\\( n = 5 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 1 (leaving 4) or take 4 (leaving 1).\n   - In both cases, Bob will win.\n   - **Losing Position for Alice**.\n\n6. **\\( n = 6 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 1 (leaving 5) or 4 (leaving 2).\n   - In both cases, Bob will win.\n   - **Losing Position for Alice**.\n\n7. **\\( n = 7 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 1 (leaving 6) or 4 (leaving 3).\n   - In both cases, Bob will win.\n   - **Losing Position for Alice**.\n\n8. **\\( n = 8 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 1 (leaving 7) or 4 (leaving 4).\n   - In both cases, Bob will win.\n   - **Losing Position for Alice**.\n\n9. **\\( n = 9 \\)**:\n   - Alice can take 1 (leaving 8) or 4 (leaving 5).\n   - In both cases, Bob will win.\n   - **Winning Position for Alice**.\n\nBy continuing this pattern, we can derive the losing positions for further values of \\( n \\).

Every losing position can be seen to be of the form:\n\\[\nn = 5k + 1, \\text{ for } k \\geq 0\n\\]\nThis means the losing positions, based on our previous calculations, can be expressed as:\n- \\( n = 5 \\)\n- \\( n = 6 \\)\n- \\( n = 7 \\)\n- \\( n = 8 \\)\n- \\( n = 13 \\)\n- \\( n = 14 \\)\n- \\( n = 15 \\)\n- \\( n = 16 \\)\n- continuing in this manner...\n\nThe subsequent group of losing positions occurs every block of 5 where one of them is of the form \\( 5k \\) or \\( 5k + 1 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Losing Positions Below 2024\n\nThe integers of form \\( 5k + 1 \\) can be calculated up to \\( 2024 \\):\n- The maximum \\( k \\) for \\( 5k + 1 \\leq 2024 \\) is \\( k = \\lfloor \\frac{2023}{5} \\rfloor = 404 \\), yielding the sequence: \\( 1, 6, 11, 16, \\ldots, 2016 \\), for which we can directly evaluate:\n\nThere are \\( 404 + 1 = 405 \\) valid \\( k \\).\n\nThe losing numbers can be identified directly from positions calculated using modular arithmetic leading to 5 based segmentation counting total losing sequences.\n\nConclusively, there are \\( \\text{Total} = 405 \\) losing positions.\n\nThe final count of values \\( n \\) (those where Bob has a forced win strategy) under 2024 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{405}\n\\]",

Here’s a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions**:\n   - A position (number of tokens, \\( n \\)) is a winning position for a player if they can move to a losing position for the opponent.\n   - Conversely, a position is a losing position if no matter how many tokens the player removes (1 or 4), the opponent can always move to a winning position.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - When \\( n = 0 \\): Losing position (the player who must play cannot make a move).\n   - When \\( n = 1 \\): Winning position (the player can take the last token).\n   - When \\( n = 2 \\): Winning position (the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 3 \\): Winning position (the player can take 1 token, leaving 2 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 4 \\): Winning position (the player can take all 4 tokens).\n   - When \\( n = 5 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 1 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 6 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 2 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 7 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 3 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 8 \\): Losing position (the player can only reach winning positions 7 or 4).\n   - When \\( n = 9 \\): Winning position (the player can take 1 token, leaving 8 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 10 \\): Winning position (the player can take 1 token, leaving 9 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 11 \\): Winning position (the player can take 1 token, leaving 10 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 12 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 8 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 13 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 9 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 14 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 10 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 15 \\): Winning position (the player can take 4 tokens, leaving 11 for the opponent).\n   - When \\( n = 16 \\): Losing position (the player can only reach winning positions 15 or 12).\n\nFrom these observations, a pattern emerges. Positions \\( n \\) can be divided based on winning (W) and losing (L):\n\n- Losing positions: \\( n = 0, 8, 16, 24, \\ldots \\)\n- Winning positions: All other integers.\n\n3. **Formulating the Pattern**:\n   - The losing positions seem to occur at \\( n = 8k \\) for \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} \\).\n   - We can generalize that the positions where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves are those that are equivalent to \\( 0 \\mod 8 \\).\n\n4. **Counting the Losing Positions**:\n   - We need to count the multiples of 8 up to 2024.\n   - The largest multiple of 8 less than or equal to 2024 is \\( \\lfloor 2024 / 8 \\rfloor \\times 8 = 2024 - (2024 \\mod 8) = 2024 - 0 = 2024 \\).\n   - The sequence of multiples of 8 up to 2024 is: \\( 0, 8, 16, \\ldots, 2024 \\).\n   - The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated from \\( 8k \\leq 2024 \\) which gives \\( k \\leq 252 \\), thus \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 252 \\) results in \\( 253 \\) terms (including 0).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob has a guaranteed winning strategy is simply the count of multiples of 8 in \\( (0, 2024] \\), which are \\( 8, 16, 24, \\ldots, 2024 \\).\n   - This corresponds to \\( 252 \\) positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{252}\n\\]",

Specifically, we find that for \\( n \\) of the form:\n\n\\[\nn \\equiv 0, 5 \\pmod{9} \n\\]\nthe position is losing for Alice.\n\n### Step 3: Counting for n ≤ 2024\n\nTo find the count of integers \\( n \\) which are losing positions less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\), we set the criteria \\( n \\equiv 0, 5 \\mod 9 \\):\n\n1. \\( 0 \\mod 9 \\):\n   - The sequence is: \\( 0, 9, 18, \\ldots, 2025 \\)\n   - Count: \\( \\frac{2025 - 0}{9} + 1 = 225 \\)\n\n2. \\( 5 \\mod 9 \\):\n   - The sequence is: \\( 5, 14, 23, \\ldots, 2022 \\)\n   - Count: \\( \\frac{2022 - 5}{9} + 1 = 224 \\)\n\n### Final Count\n\nTotal \\( n \\) values leading to losing positions:\n\n\\[\n225 + 224 = 449 \n\\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees a win is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{449}\n\\]",

So, \\( P(6) \\) is winning.\n   - If \\( n = 7 \\): Alice can take 1 (n=6), leaving a winning position for Bob, or take 4 (n=3), leaving winning for Bob.

The total integers from 1 to 2024 are 2024.\n\nNow we check how many numbers fit into these modulo conditions:\n\n1. **Count for n ≡ 0 (mod 7)**:\n   - 7, 14, ..., 2016 -> Count: \\( \\frac{2016 - 7}{7} + 1 = 288 \\)\n\n2. **Count for n ≡ 2 (mod 7)**:\n   - 2, 9, ..., 2014 -> Count: \\( \\frac{2014 - 2}{7} + 1 = 288 \\)\n\n3. **Count for n ≡ 3 (mod 7)**:\n   - 3, 10, ..., 2013 -> Count: \\( \\frac{2013 - 3}{7} + 1 = 288 \\)\n\n4. **Count for n ≡ 5 (mod 7)**:\n   - 5, 12, ..., 2018 -> Count: \\( \\frac{2018 - 5}{7} + 1 = 289 \\)\n\n5. **Count for n ≡ 6 (mod 7)**:\n   - 6, 13, ..., 2016 -> Count: \\( \\frac{2016 - 6}{7} + 1 = 288 \\)\n\n### Step 5: Add up all counts:\n\nAdding these gives:\n\n- 288 (for n ≡ 0) + 288 (for n ≡ 2) + 288 (for n ≡ 3) + 289 (for n ≡ 5) + 288 (for n ≡ 6) = 1441.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1441}\n\\]",

A position is considered a winning position for a player if they can make a move that forces their opponent into a losing position.\n\nLet's define a winning position as a position where the current player can force a win, and a losing position as one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the base cases\nWe will start with small values of \\( n \\):\n\n- **For \\( n = 1 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token and win. Thus, \\( n = 1 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 2 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token (leaving 1 for Bob) or 4 tokens (not possible). No matter what, Alice wins, so \\( n = 2 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 3 \\)**: Alice can remove 1 (leaving 2) or 4 (not possible). By removing 1, she leaves Bob in a winning position (2). Therefore, \\( n = 3 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 4 \\)**: Alice can take 4 and win immediately. Thus, \\( n = 4 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 5 \\)**: Alice can take 1 token (leaving 4 for Bob) or 4 tokens (leaving Bob 1). In either case, Bob will be left in a winning position. Thus, \\( n = 5 \\) is a losing position.\n- **For \\( n = 6 \\)**: Alice can take 1 (leaving Bob with 5, a losing position) or 4 (leaving Bob with 2, a winning position). Thus, \\( n = 6 \\) is a winning position because Alice can leave Bob in a losing position.\n- **For \\( n = 7 \\)**: Alice can take 1 (leaving Bob with 6, a winning position) or 4 (leaving Bob with 3, also winning). Thus, \\( n = 7 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 8 \\)**: Alice can take 1 (leaving Bob with 7) or 4 (leaving Bob with 4). In both cases, Bob is in a winning position.

Thus, \\( n = 9 \\) is a winning position.\n- **For \\( n = 10 \\)**: Alice can take 1 (leaving Bob with 9) or 4 (leaving Bob with 6). Again, both are winning for Bob.

Thus, \\( n = 12 \\) is a losing position.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can summarize the winning and losing positions for \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 12 \\):\n\n- Winning positions: \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 \\)\n- Losing positions: \\( 5, 8, 12 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Identify a pattern\nContinuing this reasoning, we can extend the calculations to larger values of \\( n \\) and group the results.

According to the established patterns, we can compute more of these by determining which values lead to losing states by subtracting both robot's options (1 and 4). \n\nContinuing this process:\n- The pattern suggests Bob can win when \\( n \\) is not equal to \\( 0 \\mod 5 \\).\n- The losing positions determined are: \\( n = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, \\ldots \\)\n\n### Count values of \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024\nThe strategy for Bob is guaranteed when \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\). \n\nWe can find how many such values exist less than or equal to 2024:\n\\[\nn = 5k \\quad \\text{where } k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k \\text{ such that } 5k \\leq 2024\\}\n\\]\n\\[\nk \\leq \\frac{2024}{5} = 404.8\n\\]\nThis means \\( k \\) can take integer values from 1 to 404, which is 404 possible winning values for Bob at \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the total count of positions where Bob has a winning strategy is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{404}\n\\]",
