A number is a multiple of 30 if it is a multiple of both 3 and 10.\n\n**Step 1: Condition for being a multiple of 10**\n- A number is a multiple of 10 if its last digit is 0. Therefore, since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, our candidate numbers must end with 0.\n\n**Step 2: Condition for being a multiple of 3**\n- A number is a multiple of 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 2, the sum of the digits can only be \\(2k\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of '2's in the number. \n\nTo satisfy the condition for being a multiple of 3, \\(2k\\) must be divisible by 3. This means \\(k\\) itself must be divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing the number**\nGiven that our number must end with 0, we will start constructing numbers using the digit 2. The simplest approach is to use the smallest \\(k\\) which is divisible by 3. The smallest value of \\(k\\) that satisfies this is \\(k=3\\).\n\nThus, we will have 3 occurrences of the digit '2' and one occurrence of the digit '0' at the end. This gives us the following candidates:\n- 2220\n- 2022\n- 2202\n- 0222 (not valid as it does not count as a positive integer)\n\n**Step 4: Checking the candidates**\n1. \\(2220\\):\n   - Sum of digits: \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6\\) (which is divisible by 3)\n   - Ends with 0 (divisible by 10)\n   - Therefore, \\(2220\\) is a multiple of 30.\n\n2. \\(2022\\):\n   - Sum of digits: \\(2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 6\\) (which is divisible by 3)\n   - Ends with 2 (not divisible by 10)\n   - Therefore, \\(2022\\) is **not** a multiple of 30.\n\n3. \\(2202\\):\n   - Sum of digits: \\(2 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 6\\) (which is divisible by 3)\n   - Ends with 2 (not divisible by 10)\n   - Therefore, \\(2202\\) is **not** a multiple of 30.\n\nFrom our candidates, the only valid number that meets all the criteria is \\(2220\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThus, the least positive integer multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2 is \\(\\boxed{2220}\\).",

This is a quadratic function opening upwards (since \\( a > 0 \\)). The minimum value occurs at \\( x = a \\):\n\n\\[\nf(a) = aa^2 = a^3.\n\\]\n\nAs \\( x \\) increases beyond \\( a \\), \\( f(x) \\) will also increase without bound, since \\( ax^2 \\) goes to infinity. Hence, for \\( x \\geq a \\), the values of \\( f(x) \\) range from \\( a^3 \\) to \\( +\\infty \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case \\( x < a \\)\n\nFor \\( x < a \\), the function is linear: \\( f(x) = ax + 2a \\).

Therefore, we set the two expressions equal at \\( x = a \\):\n\n\\[\na^3 = a^2 + 2a.\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives us:\n\n\\[\na^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich can be factored as:\n\n\\[\na(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis gives us one solution \\( a = 0 \\).

Thus, the possible values of \\( a \\) are \\( a = 0, 2, -1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the behavior of the function for \\( a = 2 \\)\n\nTo ensure that the graph intersects every horizontal line, we should verify the behavior at \\( a = 2 \\):\n\n- For \\( x \\geq 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) = 2x^2,\n  \\]\n  which has a minimum value of \\( 8 \\) at \\( x = 2 \\) and goes to infinity as \\( x \\) increases.\n\n- For \\( x < 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  f(x) = 2x + 4,\n  \\]\n  which is a line with slope 2. At \\( x = 2 \\), it intersects at \\( f(2) = 8 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Intersection with horizontal lines\n\nFor the range \\( f(x) \\) when \\( x < 2 \\), \\( f(x) \\) will produce values from \\( f(-\\infty) \\) (which approaches \\(-\\infty\\)) to \\( 8 \\). For \\( x \\geq 2 \\), \\( f(x) \\) produces values from \\( 8 \\) to \\( +\\infty \\).
