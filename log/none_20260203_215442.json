Therefore, we can express \\( S \\) as:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow, we can simplify the term \\( \\frac{n - 1}{n^3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{n}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, we can separate the sums:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nNow, we recognize these sums. The sum \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\) is equal to \\( p \\), and the sum \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} \\) is equal to \\( q \\). However, in \\( S \\) we start our sums from \\( n = 2 \\), so we need to adjust for the first term in each series:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.\n\\]\n\nPutting this together, we find:\n\n\\[\nS = \\left( p - 1 \\right) - \\left( q - 1 \\right) = p - q.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final result is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p - q}.\n\\]",
